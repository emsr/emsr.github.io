# I had to install a good bit:
sudo apt install -y ruby-dev
sudo gem install bundler
sudo gem install jekyll

# Build test directory to play around.
sudo jekyll new test
cd test
sudo jekyll serve

# While developing use this so the site is rescanned and rebuilt:
sudo bundle exec jekyll serve --watch

# I needed to install gems to get running.
sudo bundle install

# To update gems:
sudo bundle update

# To make the site I marched through this article:
http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/

# There is a Liquid language reference that I'll want later:
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/
